“The two things that excite me and make me vibrate, are the aesthetic feeling, beauty is what moves me and after that intelligence.” Ricardo Bofill

Since the dawn of civilisation, we practised art as an act of becoming, to find out what is inside of us and to make our souls grow.  And the new creative thinkers are no different. The fundamental difference that this persona exhibits in its relationship to arts is that it inhabits a unique space and a ready-made audience at its hand ready to assess their work anywhere, at anytime. Unlike the Art old business model in which practising art meant having superior artistic skills, expensive tactile materials, physical space to perform it, and an agent or a gallery to promote it the work.

>   *“When we get dressed we do so within the bounds of a culture and its particular norms. These norms include ones in relation to age. Within popular culture, and the related medicalized accounts that have come to dominate perception, age is primarily seen as a product of physiology, something rooted in the processes of bodily decline, evidenced by outward signs such as wrinkles, greying hair, and changes in figure and stance. But ageing also needs to be understood as a social and cultural construct.” — Julia Twigg in Fashion, the Body and Age.*

# Scenario Framing
This persona is part of a generation giving more weight to creative outlets not only for arts and science but for businesses allowing for irrationality to seep into classified rational professions.
The rise of the creative class came to stay “most Millennials consider themselves creative: 64% of global respondents to an “Insights Consulting” survey consider themselves to be creative, with Brazilian (76%) and US (73%) Millennials coming in highest.

For Gen-Z, people born after 2000, 80% of them say finding their creative voice is essential, according to a survey made by Deloitte in 2017. They develop an ability to embrace visuals and forms of expressions along and in line with the born of Tumblr, Flickr, and social media which gave them one of the biggest if not the biggest platforms for self-expression. These platforms allowed them to display their love for directness and passion, and not radicalism.

L'art pour l'art or Art-for-Art's sake is the motto of the new creative thinkers. Just like the original French Romantics who believed that true art must serve nothing at all. When it does on occasions, however, they attempt at commenting on our meta-perplexed, networked culture coming lively by brazen multimedia conceptions.

# Consuming Behaviour
The narration is central here. These Picassos are coming to rule the power of youth making art not only as a median to observe the world differently and to indicate shifting human attitudes but, above all, to actively inspire them. This inspirational role they are playing is reviving sleepy boomers and Gen-Xers through an encore creative career epitomised by, according to WGSN future consumer 2018 trend forecast, the 1990s underground feminist punk riot grrrl movement.

“The New Creative Thinkers” persona profile is relentlessly striving to use the digital wave and interactive digital imaginary to make work that is uniquely of our time. Their sources of inspiration are tightly linked to a collective feeling, pop culture and the way it is consumed.

They are on an endless self-expression mode. As insight “There is no finish line”, and as consumers, they are continually creating and hunting for inspiration. Their tools are their digital devices. Deloitte's study found consumers are 30% less likely to use mobile devices for in-store price comparisons than in 2014. The report also proposes that this may indicate that consumers are using digital more for inspiration and idea generation earlier in their shopping process, and not simply as a price comparison vehicle.

Aesthetics are their daily breakfast, and they aim to curate and express every single decision they make. When acquiring new things, they need to feel inspired to do it. They are the new global generation of creatives embracing a digital realm ostensibly existing as a pixelated reality that has sucked real life into a gleaming, depleted new dimension.They are full-heartedly invested in making themselves heard and seen, and they are not stopping anytime soon.

We wonder how a conservative art critic such as Philosopher Roger Scruton would think about our new persona. ***What would he think their artwork provides to both them and the viewer? Who is it really for? And what role of this persona profile plays in art, if any? Is this work able to move and alter perspectives?***
