Family (latin for household):  Network of people who care for each other. Someone who encourages your talents, cushion your heartaches, tolerates your complaints and jokes.

<a href="https://www.vinhood.com/homepage/" target="_blank">Vinhood</a> is an Italian startup compose by a group of wine aficionados. Their love for the world of wine inspired them to create the perfect algorithm to communicate wine tastes, culture, and its connection to the Italian way of being.

The four entrepreneurs reached Bad Accents to ideate a concept for an event that would embrace their brand essence **grasping knowledge** and translate it into a night with their intimate community.

### CONCEPT###
## TABLE NARRATIVES (COMMENSALITY)##
> COMMENSALITY : THE PRACTICE OF COMING TOGETHER AROUND A TABLE TO BREAK BOTH BREAD AND BOUNDARIES.

The narrative of sharing a meal is one of the most intimate acts, human beings have eaten together in all different cultures and eras. The value of sharing a meal, however, has been overlooked, abandoned, and replaced with grabbing something to eat on the go for lack of time.

Sharing a meal reflects the primitive human need for connection. Bad Accents believed the best way to show it to the Vinhood family is through “ setting the table”, a theme about gathering, sharing, and creating a narrative around **THE TABLE.**

Our central insight here was “The act of breaking bread and sharing a meal is something that’s so instinctual and human”.We wanted to help Vinhood to act in a meaningful way and take an active role in their family/ community.
>To eat in the company of others is a strong expression of trust and “togetherness” of a much higher other than just “being together.

**Set the table** symbolises a ritual around an object, curating the perfect table for the fondest people in your life, projecting an intimate energy and a family feel.

The journey started by choosing the perfect menu created by the Chefs Francesco & Mauro to set a tone of Italian summery vibes, followed by setting the place through a warm colour theme and the hosting of the Vinhood family and friends.

We believe that portraying the value of this “togetherness” is one of the most relevant values surrounding wine “La Bella Vita Italiana.” Reflected in the exchange of food on a table— the more food and wine the better the serata will be. And voila; the Vinhood Summer Edition was born.

### OUTCOME###

A memorable night, becoming a family we definitely choose. Aside from a community, the value of this intimacy moved us into a family territory, and those are the nights that count and remembered. Evenings that you share an experience with people who are no longer strangers but family.

Let’s keep setting the table in the future, let’s never forget this beautiful tradition of gathering and togetherness.
